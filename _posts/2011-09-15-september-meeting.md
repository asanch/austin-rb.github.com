Rather than our regularly-scheduled meeting, we'll be meeting at [Ginger Man](http://maps.google.com/maps?client=safari&rls=en&q=ginger+man+austin&oe=UTF-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wl) tonight, starting at 8PM. There's a lot to talk about, what with [RubyConf](http://rubyconf.org/) around the corner, as well as the future of Austin.RB as a group, and what that should look like.

It'll be real. Hope to see you there.
