date: 2011-11-1
---

Good news! Our next meeting will be on Tuesday November 15 from [7:30-9:30 at Cospace](http://plancast.com/p/88db). We're excited to have [Trevor Rosen](https://twitter.com/trevrosen) presenting a "code-along adventure" about creating dashboards dashboards with Redis. We're also excited to announce that our November meeting will be sponsored by [Spiceworks](http://www.spiceworks.com/)! They'll also be buying drinks at [Sherlock's Baker Street Pub](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?q=sherlocks+baker+street+pub&cid=13119996996392273995) after the meeting.

And since it was so successful last time, we'll be pairing off to work through a brand new <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)'>code kata</a>. Be sure to bring your laptop!

Anyway, let's hear more about Trevor's talk, eh?

> By now, most people have had to make some kind of dashboard. They present some interesting challenges. 
>
> We will be imagining that the fictional business of Rufus' Pig Foot Emporium has hired us to create a dashboard for their flagship OinkBot Global Pork Statistical Service™, because it gives us an opportunity to create a lightweight gem making use of Redis.  We'll put together a library called RedisCacheable to add Redis-backed caching behavior to arbitrary Ruby classes in an organized and direct way.   
>
> Along the way, we'll have a practical look at/touch on:
>
> • Redis, an excellent and simple data store
> • Some metaprogramming techniques used for mixins
> • Basics of gem structure and construction: 
>   • Using Bundler to make gem stubs
>   • Creating config objects available in base classes
>   • The virtues of namespaces
> • Test-driven development with RSpec

See y'all there! 

Oh, and thanks for your patience as we try to figure out a consistent meeting time--we'll have that figured out soon.
