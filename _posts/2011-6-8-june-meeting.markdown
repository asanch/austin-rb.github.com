title: "June Meeting - Ruby Implementation Showdown! Brian Ford on Rubinius & Mattt Thompson on MacRuby"
date: 2011-6-8
---

Our June meeting of Austin.RB is June 16. As always, we'll be meeting at [Norris Conference Center](http://gowalla.com/spots/189667), and talks will start around 7PM. 

You'll definitely want to make it for this one, since it's going to be all about the new and exciting things happening in Ruby implementations. It's a showdown, folks! [Brian Ford](http://brightredglow.com/) of [Engine Yard](http://www.engineyard.com/) will be joining us to talk about [Rubinius](http://rubini.us/), and [Mattt Thompson](http://mattt.me/) will be giving a tell-all about [MacRuby](http://www.macruby.org/).

And if that weren't enough, **Engine Yard will be sponsoring socialization practice** afterwards at [Sherlock's Baker Street Pub](http://gowalla.com/spots/58416). Come on out and let EY Buy UA Drank (_shawty_).

Anyway, you want some talk abstracts? You got it, chief!

> Rubinius is a completely new implementation of Ruby featuring a custom virtual machine, garbage collector, and JIT compiler, and true multi-threaded concurrency. The Rubinius core library is written in Ruby with supporting primitives from the VM. The bytecode compiler is also written in Ruby. Rubinius is bring the past 30 years of dynamic language implementation to Ruby using modern technology like the [LLVM](http://llvm.org) project. I'll take a dive into the architecture and goals of Rubinius. I'm interested in hearing about Ruby pain points and what Rubinius can do to help.

> MacRuby is another implementation of Ruby, built on top of the Objective-C runtime and JIT compiler. It harnesses Grand Central Dispatch to take advantage of multi-core CPUs and GPUs to offer _unparalleled_ multi-threaded concurrency performance (get it?). But performance is just the beginning: with MacRuby, you have full access to some pretty amazing Apple Frameworks, like `Foundation`, `CoreAudio`, and `Accelerate`. And the best part? You get all of this and _still_ get to program Ruby. Think of this as your introduction to Cocoa, without the dangerous square-bracket edges of Objective-C.

See y'all there!
