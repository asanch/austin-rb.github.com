Hey there, this is [Mattt](http://mattt.me/). I'm breaking from my standard persona as the 3rd-person voice of Austin.RB to speak personally for a bit.

Come January, I will be moving to San Francisco to start my new job at [Heroku](http://heroku.com/). As such, I will be unable to continue my role of organizing and running Austin.RB month-to-month.

But Austin.RB won't be going anywhere—not even close.

It is as remarkable and wonderful as it is totally unsurprising the way that our community has already stepped forward after mentioning my move at the last meeting. I am _thrilled_ to say that of the 10 scheduled meetings for 2012, [the first half of them are already accounted for](https://github.com/austin-rb/Meetings/wiki/2012-Meeting-Schedule). My sincere thanks go out to [Tim Tyrell](https://twitter.com/timtyrrell), [Mando Escamilla](https://twitter.com/mandoescamilla), [Brad Fults](https://twitter.com/h3h), [Robert Rasmussen](https://twitter.com/robrasmussen), [Nola Stowe](https://twitter.com/rubygeekdotcom), and [Rob Mack](https://twitter.com/robmack) for volunteering to head up those meetings. I have the fullest confidence that each of you will do an amazing job (and to be honest, I'm really bummed that I'll be missing those, now).

If you are also interested in taking charge of a meeting, just [follow the instructions on the wiki page](https://github.com/austin-rb/Meetings/wiki/2012-Meeting-Schedule).

It's been my distinct pleasure to build Austin.RB with all of you, together. I think we finally hit our stride in the last couple meetings, and I'm genuinely excited to see where you take things over the coming months.

There is something truly wonderful and unique about this community, down here in the heart of Texas. For 2 years, Austin has been my home. So much of being able to call this place home has come from the friendships I've made with y'all. Thank you.
