Good news! Our next meeting will be on Tuesday January 17 from
[7:30-9:30 at Cospace](http://plancast.com/p/9c8c). We're excited to
have [Matthew Swain](https://twitter.com/mswain) give us an
introduction to keeping our environment dependencies managed using Ruby
with Chef. We're also
excited to announce that our January meeting will be sponsored by
[OtherInbox](http://www.otherinbox.com/)! Afterwards we will head for drinks at [Sherlock's Baker Street Pub](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?q=sherlocks+baker+street+pub&cid=13119996996392273995).

After the presentation we'll be pairing off to work through a brand new <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)'>code kata</a>. Be sure to bring your laptop!

Anyway, let's hear more about Matthew's talk, eh?

>Today's applications can be quite complex with many external dependencies.  In addition to our ruby environments, often we find ourselves setting up a patchwork of tools like memcached, node, mysql, redis, cassandra, mongo, and nginx.  Keeping our development and production environments up to date can be quite the chore.  Thankfully, we can automate the process with Chef.
>
>Chef is a ruby framework that can ease the burden of managing all of our applications' dependencies.  Whether we're dealing with a development workstation, a single application server, or hundreds of EC2 slices; Chef makes it easy to keep everything under control.  In this talk I'll cover the basics of the framework, including how to get in installed and configured to get you cooking quickly.
