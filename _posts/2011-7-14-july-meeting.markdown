In these dog days of summer, at the peak of conference season, with heated deadlines for Fall project releases, let's relax this month. July's meeting of Austin.RB will be a "Show-and-Tell" of all of the cool gems you've come across recently. Come up and share your experiences with your new favorite library, framework, script, or what have you. Nothing fancyâ€”just ~5 minutes, fireside-chat -style.

Some Ideas: [Ohm](http://ohm.keyvalue.org/), [Resque](https://github.com/defunkt/resque), [Fog](http://fog.io/), [Hashie](http://intridea.com/2009/11/12/hashie-the-hash-toolkit?blog=company), [HTTParty](http://railstips.org/blog/archives/2008/07/29/it-s-an-httparty-and-everyone-is-invited/), [Spork](https://github.com/timcharper/spork), [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard), [Event Machine](http://rubyeventmachine.com/), [Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara), [Time Cop](https://github.com/jtrupiano/timecop), [Keytar](https://github.com/schneems/keytar).

Same time and place as always: [Norris Conference Center](http://gowalla.com/spots/189667) from 7 - 9. We'll be taking the party to [Sherlocke's Baker Street Pub](http://gowalla.com/spots/58416) afterwards. Looking forward to seeing y'all there!
