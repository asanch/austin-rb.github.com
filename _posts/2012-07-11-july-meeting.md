title: "July Meeting - Testing Assembly with Ruby"
date: 2012-07-11

Please see NEW LOCATION!!!

Synopsis:
Writing assembly code is a challenge to even the masters of the art.  These days most programmers professionally write assembly only when they must have the most optimal execution speed of a specific routine or create the smallest code possible.  Doing so will also typically prevent the application from being portable.  On the other hand, some of the more masochistic programmers out there like myself like to write assembly code every once in a while just for the fun of it.

One of the biggest problems with writing assembly code is the readability and maintainability of it.  Almost every instruction written can have very specific or very subtle meaning.  Even with code comments on every line and a paragraph explaining what a particular section does, it can still be extremely difficult to remember exactly why a particular section was coded in a certain way.  This talk is about bringing one of the best techniques about Ruby that has made it so successful, to what some people might call its antithesis; writing in assembly.  Automated testing has allowed Ruby to proliferate with very high code quality and maintainability.

Writing tests for assembly code in Ruby is now easy and fun for the whole family.
