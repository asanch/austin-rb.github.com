It <del>will feature "Ten Weird Things About Ruby", a talk by Brian Bommarito</del>. Afterwards, we'll meet up for drinks at [Trudy's North Star](http://gowalla.com/spots/59935). Hope y'all can make it out!

**Update (4/21)**: Our speaker tonight has cancelled, so we'll be doing Lighting Talks instead. Got a favorite Ruby project of the moment? Come up and tell us about it. Just 5 minutes, no biggie. It'll be a blast--can't wait to see what everyone presents on!
