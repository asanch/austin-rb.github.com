title: "September Meeting - Front-end Web Development with Ruby"
date: 2012-09-06
---

**Synopsis:**
While Ruby came to prominence with Rails as a solution for quickly and elegantly
building full stack web applications, the past couple of years have seen an
explosion of the number of Ruby projects catering to the needs of front-end web
developers specifically. From using Middleman or nanoc to manage the process of
building a static site, to using Compass to bring sanity to our stylesheets, to
building custom gems to simplify JavaScript development workflow, this talk will
cover several scenarios in which developers can bring the ease and simplicity of
Ruby to bear on time-consuming or otherwise frustrating front-end problems. We
will also cover using one of the new Backend as a Service providers to build a
dynamic website entirely on the client side, radically simplifying the process of
deployment.

Matt gave this talk at LSRC last month and [it went over quite well](http://speakerrate.com/talks/13091)
(at least he likes to think so). If you missed it there, be sure to join us this
month to learn how to tame your markup with Ruby!

**Bio:**
Matt Buck has been bouncing around a number of local Austin startups since he
graduated from UT six years ago. Currently he makes Internets for [Mass
Relevance](http://massrelevance.com), and he couldn't be happier with how that's
going. If he isn't staring at a lightbox, he's probably enjoying the great
indoors in some other suitably sedentary fashion.

**Location:**
Thanks again to [Capital Factory](http://capitalfactory.com) for providing the space for this month's meeting! You can find them in the 16th floor of the Omni Hotel, downtown at 701 Brazos St. 

We'll be heading to B.D. Riley's afterwards for socialization practice.
See y'all there!
