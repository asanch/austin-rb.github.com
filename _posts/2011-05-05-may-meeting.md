We'll be having our May meeting of Austin.RB on May 19, with the same time and venue as last time--[Norris Conference Center]((http://gowalla.com/spots/189667)) at 7PM. Our speakers are [Charles Lowell](https://twitter.com/cowboyd/) and [Bill Doughty](https://twitter.com/capbuzzman/). 

Charles will talk about [The Ruby Racer](https://github.com/cowboyd/therubyracer), a slick gem that lets you embed Javascript in Ruby in elegant fashion:

> Have you ever had to implement the same validation logic twice: once in JavaScript for the browser and once in Ruby for the server? Has there ever been a JavaScript library like [handlebars.js](http://handlebars.strobeapp.com/) that you'd love to use server side, but can't because well... it's in JavaScript and not Ruby? Or perhaps a time or two you've been tempted to eval() some anonymous Ruby code, but you didn't dare because it's an unspeakably dangerous thing to do?
>
> The solutions to these and many other problems are suddenly and elegantly within your grasp when you've got the power of a JavaScript interpreter right there with you in your ruby process.
>
> Sound crazy? difficult? It's easier than you might think. This talk will focus on [The Ruby Racer](https://github.com/cowboyd/therubyracer): a gem that brings the superb [V8 interpteter](http://code.google.com/p/v8/) to Ruby. We'll see how to call JavaScript functions directly from Ruby; how to call Ruby methods directly from JavaScript; how to extend Ruby classes with JavaScript; how to extend your JavaScript objects with Ruby, and a slew of other ways of managing their interaction that will bend your mind

Next up will be Bill, presenting on [Typhoeus](https://github.com/dbalatero/typhoeus), a library named after the [mythical creature with 100 serpent heads](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhon), that manages the execution of parallel HTTP requests like a champ.

> Typhoeus leverages a standard Unix tool (`curl`) to overcome one area where Ruby is inherently deficient (concurrency) within a specific application context: HTTP client networking.  What's more, it does so in an idiomatic way. In short, Typhoeus provides a great example of how to effectively leverage a ubiquitous yet powerful native library in a transparent and Ruby-friendly way.

Afterwards, we'll be heading to [Sherlock's Baker Street Pub](http://gowalla.com/spots/58416) for socialization practice.

Thanks again to everyone who came out last month! Really hope y'all will be able to come out this time. And to all of you [RailsConf](http://en.oreilly.com/rails2011) folks, safe travels and see you in June.
