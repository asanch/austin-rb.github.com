Fellow Rubyists,

Our next meeting will be on the **new and improved second Wednesday** of the
month: **May 9**, from [7:30-9:30 at Cospace](http://plancast.com/p/ba7e).
Our talk will be from [Michael May](https://twitter.com/ehm_may) of 
[Power Smart Labs](https://twitter.com/PowerSmartLabs).

Happily, [CabForward](http://www.cabforward.com/) will be sponsoring our
April meeting. They are a Ruby on Rails design, development and
training company located in beautiful Austin, Texas.

After the presentation we’ll be pairing off to work through a brand new
[code kata][1]. You’ll definitely want to remember your laptop.

Here’s Michael's talk synopsis:

> Data centers use lots of energy. Unfortunately, large amounts of this
> are wasted by servers not doing any useful work. Power Smart Labs is an
> early stage startup that makes software to reduce data center energy
> usage. In this talk I will be showing off our technology stack.

> Along the way we will encounter things such as: Sinatra vs. Rails, using
> Active Record with Sinatra, executing time-based jobs with Ruby, and
> optimizing optimization algorithms.

Customarily, after our meeting, we’ll head over to [Sherlock’s Baker Street Pub][2] for refreshments and conversation.
