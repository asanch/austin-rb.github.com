title: "April Meeting - SNMP Device Emulation & Ruby with Brian Gugliemetti"
date: 2012-04-03

Fellow Rubyists,

Our next meeting will be on the **new and improved second Wednesday** of the
month: **April 11**, from [7:30-9:30 at Cospace](http://plancast.com/p/asmc).
Our talk will be from [Brian Gugliemetti](https://github.com/briangug) of
Spiceworks, who is going to regale us mightily with tales of SNMP
Virtualization with Ruby. It may or may not create entirely new neuronal
pathways in your gray matter.

Happily, [Spiceworks](http://www.spiceworks.com/) will be sponsoring our
April meeting. They do great things for IT with Ruby right here in our very
own Austin, Texas.

After the presentation we’ll be pairing off to work through a brand new
[code kata][1]. You’ll definitely want to remember your laptop.

Here’s Brian’s talk synopsis:

> One of problems with writing code that manages a group of devices is having
> a wide variety of devices to test against. Even if one has budget, space
> quickly becomes an issue. Spiceworks wrote a SNMP device emulator to use for
> both product support and regression testing. The emulator allows Spiceworks to
> use a single server to create multiple virtual SNMP devices from
> user-submitted SNMP walks to resolve support issues. Learn how to use Ruby to
> dynamically manage multiple ethernet aliases and services on a single machine.

Customarily, after our meeting, we’ll head over to [Sherlock’s Baker Street Pub][2] for refreshments and conversation.

We’ll see y’all there!
