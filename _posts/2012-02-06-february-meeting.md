Good news! Our next meeting will be on Tuesday Feb 21 from
[7:30-9:30 at Cospace](http://plancast.com/p/9qxv). [Charles Lowell](https://twitter.com/cowboyd) 
is gonna ROCK OUR FREAKIN' MINDS WITH HIS CRAZY JENKINS KNOWLEDGE!  WOOOOOO!

We're also completely stoked that [The Frontside](http://www.thefrontside.net/)
is sponsoring our February meeting - if your backside is strong but your
frontside is weak, call The Frontside today!

After the presentation we'll be pairing off to work through a brand new <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)'>code kata</a>. Be sure to bring your laptop!

As is our way, after the pairing we will head for drinks at [Sherlock's Baker Street Pub](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?q=sherlocks+baker+street+pub&cid=13119996996392273995).

And straight from the Charles' mouth about his talk:

> Over ten years after Martin Fowler first coined the term, continuous
> integration isn't something controversial. Like testing, it might not be
> something we always do, but it is something we almost always know we
> should. How then, do we as Rubyists turn this inclination into practice?
>
> Enter Jenkins, the highest power CI server out there.
>
> In this short talk, I'll compare Jenkins to some other CI solutions
> before showing you some great ways you can use it to supercharge both
> the development AND deployment of your Ruby projects. Finally, I will
> demonstrate how you can extend the Jenkins CI server (which is written
> in Java) with nothing Ruby code.
>
> If you aren't getting the most out of your CI tools, or you aren't
> using a CI tool at all, then it is important that you attend!
> Implementing a proper CI is a game changer to the way you and your team
> develop software.
>
> [Charles Lowell](https://github.com/cowboyd) is a founder and UX
> developer at [The Frontside](http://thefrontside.net) in Austin, Texas where
> he slings code for money and spends way too much of his free time
> contributing to open source projects such as The Ruby Racer and Jenkins.

> Ruby is a passion, but he always makes sure to pack his toothbrush and
> JavaScript wherever he goes.

See y'all there!
