# Sad News

With [LSRC](http://www.lonestarrubyconf.com/) right around the corner, we've decided to take this month off and focus on the conference.  

I know, I know - I'm sad about it too.  But, we do have some happy news to go with the sad!

# Happy News!

Instead of the meeting, we're going to participate in [Context.IO's](http://context.io) awesome [overnight hackathon](http://blog.context.io/2012/08/announcing-the-lsrc-overnight-hackathon-in-austin-texas-august-11th)!  Drinks, food, open APIs, good friends and late-night hacking - if that doesn't sound like a rad Saturday night, dear reader, I don't know what does.

It starts the evening of 8/11 (directly after LSRC) at the  super-sweet [Capital Factory](http://www.capitalfactory.com/) space on 7th and Brazos.  If you're interested, [register up](http://lsrchackathon.eventbrite.com/) (totes free) and join us.

See y'all there!
