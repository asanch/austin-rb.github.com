title: "June Meeting - Making Gems"
date: 2012-06-13
---

Synopsis:
If you've used Ruby, you've probably used a gem or two.  Ruby's gem system has worked out pretty well as a way to share code with other people or between your own projects. 
But how to actually make a gem is not quite widely known.  It's not that the process is actually difficult.  It's just the documentation isn't so clear. Many different methods have popped up over the years for making gems, and we'll take a look at a few of them.  We'll also look at how to make a gem with native code bindings.

Bio:
Ethan is a professional software developer of 7 years and has been working with Ruby for 5 of them. He currently works at GameSalad and runs Big-Oh Studios doing iOS development and some consulting gigs on the side.  Ethan enjoys spending time with his family, playing guitar, and is a candidate for US Congress in Williamson and Bell Counties.

Sponsor: [GameSalad](http://www.gamesalad.com) will be the sponsors for Cospace. They are an Austin based game tool company to allow you to make games without programming. They have a mac version and the newly released Windows version. You can publish your game on mac, iphone, ipad, android and html5 from the same project.

Customarily, after our meeting, we’ll head over to [Sherlock’s Baker Street Pub][1] for refreshments and conversation.
